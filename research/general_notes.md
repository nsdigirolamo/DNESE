# Explaining the Family Computer (Famicom) & NES

The NES was originally released in Japan in 1983 as the Famicom and fully
released in 1986 as the NES. It was distributed in Europe, Australia, and Asia
throughout the 1980s under various names.

The Famicom looks much different than the NES, and notably lacks the [10NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC_(Nintendo)#10NES)
lockout chip.

# Explaining NTSC & PAL

The NES existed in the era of cathode-ray tube (CRT) display technology. There
was no universal standard for CRT displays, and two main versions existed across
the regions where the NES was sold.

## National Television System Committee (NTSC)

Developed in the United States in 1953 and used by Canada, Japan, the majority
of the Americas, and some countries in Asia. NTSC Uses 525 lines per frame at
60 Hz, operating at 30 fps.

## Phase Alternating Line (PAL)

Developed in the 1960s and used by Europe, Australia, and some countries in
Asia and South America. PAL uses 625 lines per frame at 50 Hz, operating at
25 fps.

### PAL-A & PAL-B Variants

Nintendo partnered with multiple companies before founding Nintendo of Europe in
1990. These multiple partnerships made it difficult for Nintendo to control who
was selling what products. To remedy this, Nintendo created two regions out of
the non-Asian PAL countries.

Most games released by third party publishers were marked as either PAL-A or
PAL-B. First party games published by Nintendo themselves did not receive this
distinction, and instead were marked with [regional version labels.](https://www.thelegendofnes.com/id-codes)

Nintendo used the [10NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CIC_(Nintendo)) lockout
chip to prevent PAL-A games from being played on PAL-B consoles and vice-versa.

## Sequential Color and Memory (SECAM)

Used in Russia, China, and Africa by NES and Famicom clone consoles.
